              stale that it was decided not to be worth including.

              Where does the course information come from?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Everything comes from Stanford, but not all of it at the same speed. Titles, descriptions,
              units, instructors, and meeting times are copied from the official course catalog once a
              day. Seat counts are asked for the moment you open a course, so they are current to within
              a minute. Evaluations show up whenever Stanford publishes them, which is after a term
              ends. Verify enrollment status, prerequisites, meeting times, and deadlines in official
              Stanford systems before making academic decisions.

              Where does a course&apos;s rating come from, and why doesn&apos;t it match the charts?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Ratings are built from the student responses in Stanford&apos;s published course
              evaluations. A course with only a handful of responses is nudged toward the Stanford
              average, so a 5.00 from three students does not outrank a strong rating from four hundred.
              That is why the rating shown can sit a little below what the response charts further down
              would suggest on their own.

              restricts evaluation results to the Stanford community. Stanford Root follows that same
              boundary. Anyone can browse courses and build a schedule without signing in.

              Do I need an account to use Stanford Root?

            <p>
              No. As stated above, course browsing and schedule building are available to everyone. A
              Stanford account is only required to view evaluations and sync a schedule across devices.

              No. Stanford Root is an independent course discovery and scheduling tool. It is not

              Yes. Feedback from the help button is never attached to your Stanford account, even when
